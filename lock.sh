# Pause and unpause dunst. From the manual dunst(1):

# When paused dunst will not display any notifications but keep all notifications
# in a queue.  This can for example be wrapped around a screen locker (i3lock, slock)
# to prevent flickering of notifications through the lock and
# to read all missed notifications after returning to the computer.
